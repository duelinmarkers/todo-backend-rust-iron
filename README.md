# todo-backend-rust-iron

See http://todo-backend.thepete.net/ for *what-is-this-thing?*.

This is the first Rust I've written other than the Hello-Worldly stuff in the
[Rust Guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html), so it is likely not idiomatic.

Rust isn't stable yet, but Iron REALLY isn't stable yet. A `cargo update` is
guaranteed to break things.

```
$ ./versions.sh 
rustc 0.12.0-pre-nightly (4dfdc697e 2014-08-21 00:51:00 +0000)
cargo 0.0.1-pre-nightly (5a4247e 2014-08-20 18:29:03 +0000)
```
