# todo-backend-rust-iron

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/duelinmarkers/todo-backend-rust-iron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/duelinmarkers/todo-backend-rust-iron)

See http://todo-backend.thepete.net/ for *what-is-this-thing?*.

This is the first Rust I've written other than the Hello-Worldly stuff in the
[Rust Guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html), so it is likely not idiomatic.
Please let me know if you know better!

Neither Rust now Iron are stable yet, so a `cargo update` is likely to break things.
See recent commit messages for the last known-good Rust and Cargo versions.
