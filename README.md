# todo-backend-rust-iron

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/duelinmarkers/todo-backend-rust-iron.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/duelinmarkers/todo-backend-rust-iron)

See http://todo-backend.thepete.net/ for *what-is-this-thing?*.

This is the first Rust I've written other than the Hello-Worldly stuff in the
[Rust Guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html), so it is likely not
idiomatic.
Please let me know if you know better!

Neither Rust nor Iron are stable yet, so a `cargo update` is likely to break
things.
See recent commit messages for the last known-good Rust and Cargo versions.

After `git clone`ing, `cargo run` and load
http://todo-backend.thepete.net/specs/index.html?http://localhost:3000/ in your
browser to run Pete's specs against it.
